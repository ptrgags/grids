# Grids (2016)

This project is an exploration of various types of grids (rectangular, hexagonal, 3D, etc) for use in strategy and puzzle games.

This project uses [Processing](https://processsing.org) and [Python Mode for Processing](http://py.processing.org/).

Once we get a clean API prototyped in Python, I plan to translate the code to C# for use in Unity.

The Processing sketch has several examples. To switch between them, use `Ctrl + Left` and `Ctrl + Right`
